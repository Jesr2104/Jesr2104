I consider myself as a responsible, dedicated and efficient person in the tasks I do. I become very focused and motivated with my duties and responsibilities.
Related to a work environment, I am an easy-going person, good in a team work atmosphere and a hard worker. I also can bring new ideas and creativity to the workplace.
With my experience I have improved my logical skills to solve real life problems.
